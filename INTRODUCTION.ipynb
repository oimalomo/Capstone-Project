            "source": "It is widely known that the Nigerian economy is cash-driven. Financial transactions ranging from buying a bottle of water worth N100 (about USD0.27) to commercial transactions worth hundreds of million of Naira are largely settled by cash. The immediate effect of this problem is glaring in the fight against anti-terrorism and corruption, as some unscrupulous persons take undue advantage of this issue for diverse nefarious reasons.  \n  \nSeveral reports indicate that the major reason for this dilemma is that a large percentage of the Nigerian population are \u2018under-banked\u2019 or \u2018un-banked\u2019. These terms refer to those who do not do their financial transactions through banks basically because they are not literate or semi-literate. These reports also indicate that this group of persons are residents of rural or semi-urban locations. Most Nigerian banks do not have a presence in these areas because of uncertainty in business profitability and insecurity amongst other reasons.  \n  \nThe apex bank of Nigeria, Central Bank of Nigeria, recently designed a financial inclusion policy to bridge the divide between the financial sphere and the \u2018un-banked\u2019. This financial inclusion policy is a state where financial services are delivered by range of providers, mostly individuals or businesses in the private sector. Once licensed, the approved individuals or businesses will be able to administer basic banking transactions in a rural or semi-urban location.  \n\n### BUSINESS PROBLEM  \n  \nIt is usually a dilemma for prospective businesses to choose a location to operate their Financial Services Centre (FSC). This is because several factors, such as proximity to a commercial bank or proximity to a police station, must be considered before settling for a location. It is not unusual for prospective FSCs to visit several locations before making a choice. This project tries to take away the guesswork involved, by limiting the choice to a range of locations.\n",

I have combed the web for a dataset of remote locations and their geographical coordinates in Edo State, but the best I could get was a list of the locations alone. The url to this list is [here](http://www.amicidilazzaro.it/index.php/all-villages-town-and-cities-in-edo-state/).  \n  \nThe list of locations was obtained in a raw form, and it had no structure at all. I derived the data from the web page using the BeautifulSoup library and the \u2018lxml\u2019 parser. Even after derivation of the data, I had to perform several string operations on it before I could get a somewhat formatted copy. The formatted list had 1,391 rows. Here is a sample of the formatted list.  \n  \n' '|Town\n--| -----\n0|Akuku\n1|Ewan\n2|Utua-Ufa\n3|Igarra\n4|Samorika\n5|Sasaro\n6|Ago-Ogbodo\n7|Ijaja\n8|Okpe\n9|Oloma  \n  \n\n I must state that all geolocation/geocoding lookup were done using Google API. I attempted to use the Nominatim OSM tool. After 1 iteration with Nominatim, which lasted 2 hours, it did not return any coordinate. This made me opt for Google API, which turned out to be relatively faster, and it returned the desired coordinates.  \n   \nThe geocoding function returns a column which concatenates the location formatted address, latitude and longitude. \n  \n''|Town\t|Coord\t \n--|---|---\n0\t|Akuku|\t['Edo, Nigeria', 6.5438101, 5.898713900000001]\t \n1\t|Ewan|\t['Edo, Nigeria', 6.5438101, 5.898713900000001]\t \n2\t|Utua-Ufa|\t['Utua, Nigeria', 7.280911000000001, 6.102346799999999]\t \n3\t|Igarra|\t['Igarra, Nigeria', 7.2754704, 6.107645000000001]\t \n4\t|Samorika|\t['Nigeria', 7.399570300000001, 6.1348042]\t \n5\t|Sasaro|\t['Edo, Nigeria', 6.5438101, 5.898713900000001]\t \n6\t|Ago-Ogbodo|\t['Ogbodo, Nigeria', 7.253213199999999, 5.9353685]\t \n7\t|Ijaja|\t['Edo, Nigeria', 6.5438101, 5.898713900000001]\t \n8\t|Okpe|\t['Okpe, Nigeria', 7.284576399999999, 6.029459]\t \n9\t|Oloma|\t['Edo, Nigeria', 6.5438101, 5.898713900000001]\t \n  \n  \nAfter further string operations are performed on the \u2018Coord\u2019 column to separate the components, the resulting dataframe looks like this.\n\n''|\tTown|\tLocation|\tLatitude|\tLongitude\n--|--|--|--|--\n0|\tAkuku|\tEdo, Nigeria|\t6.5438101|\t5.8987139\n1|\tEwan|\tEdo, Nigeria|\t6.5438101|\t5.8987139\n2|\tUtua-Ufa|\tUtua, Nigeria|\t7.280911|\t6.1023468\n3|\tIgarra|\tIgarra, Nigeria|\t7.2754704|\t6.107645\n4|\tSamorika|\tNigeria|\t7.3995703|\t6.134804\n5|\tSasaro|\tEdo, Nigeria|\t6.5438101|\t5.8987139\n6|\tAgo-Ogbodo|\tOgbodo, Nigeria|\t7.2532132|\t5.935368\n7|\tIjaja|\tEdo, Nigeria|\t6.5438101|\t5.8987139\n8|\tOkpe|\tOkpe, Nigeria|\t7.2845764|\t6.02945\n9|\tOloma|\tEdo, Nigeria|\t6.5438101|\t5.8987139\n\n  \nOne major requirement of the FSC solution is that few or no bank must be within 3km of the selected location. They also require that a police station, along with other businesses should preferably be within 3km of the selected location. These requirements thus perfectly position us to query the \u2018nearest venues\u2019 within 3km using the Google API.  \n  \nThe obtained geolocation data are passed into Google API to generate venues within 3km to each location. The result of that query yields a dataframe with sample shown below:  \n  \n''|Neighborhood\t|Neighborhood Latitude|\tNeighborhood Longitude|\tVenue|\tVenue Latitude|\tVenue Longitude|\tVenue Category\n--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--\n23|\tUtua-Ufa|\t7.280911|\t6.1023468|\tTotal Ibillo Petrol Service Station|\t7.2795305|\t6.1105203|\tgas_station\n24|\tUtua-Ufa|\t7.280911|\t6.1023468|\tKeystone Bank|\t7.276497|\t6.113958|\tbank\n25|\tUtua-Ufa|\t7.280911|\t6.1023468|\tUnity Bank Atm|\t7.2826535|\t6.1016443|\tschool\n\n  \n This is the data that I used to cluster the locations into groups, before inferences can be made.\n",

I settled for Google API because it provided a marginally faster operation, with unlimited calls.  \n  \nTo get the nearby venues from Google, the required parameters are;  \n  \n1.\tKey \u2013 The application\u2019s API key. Like Nominatim, a limited number of requests are allowed daily without an API key, but this restriction is lifted once a valid API is provided.  \n  \n2.\tLocation \u2013 The coordinates (in Latitude and Longitude) around which to retrieve the venues.  \n  \n3.\tRadius \u2013 The distance (in meters) from the target location within which results should be drawn. In this project it is 3000m.  \n  \nThe geocoding request in a statement line as shown below;  \n  \nhttps://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/nearbysearch/json?location= 6.749140499999, 6.0732146&radius=1500&type=restaurant&keyword=cruise&key=YOUR_API_KEY  \n  \n  \nThe example above requests for the venues within a 1500m radius of Ekpoma, Edo, Nigeria. This explains how the list of venues used for the analysis are obtained.  \n  \nThe result of the venues lookup around the list of locations returned a result with 62 unique venue categories.

For instance, a location with a great presence of banks and other kinds of financial institutions will not be beneficial to the business.  \n  \nThis kind of business problem requires a clustering algorithm. The locations need to be clustered based on the categories of venues, then each cluster is to be examined to identify the characteristic venues, and by extension, determine if they are suitable for a prospective FSC or not. I opted to use the k-means clustering algorithm to cluster the locations and the venues.  \n  \n  To determine the ideal number of clusters, I used the cdist function in the scipy.spatial.distance library to get a distortion array. Plotting this array against a range of k values returned an elbow graph, which indicated k=5 as the optimum value of k.\n",

            "source": "## DISCUSSION  \n  \nIt has been determined that banks and other financial institutions are direct competitors of FSCs, and as a result it will be unheathy for any prospective location be chosen anywhere near a high concentration of banks. It would also be preferable that the choice location have a police station close to it. Also, a good number of small businesses will ensure a good patronage for an FSC.  \n  \nHaving set these criteria, it is obvious that Cluster 5 is not suitable at all, becasue it has a high concentration of banks - 61. Any location chosen within this cluster will have to compete directly with these institutions.  \n  \nClusters 1, 2, 3 and 4 all have a good number of small businesses, which will most likely lead to patronage of an FSC, but we cannot make a decison based on such a wide range of clusters as these 4 clusters cover 292 locations. So we have to figure out a way of picking an ideal location.  \n  \nCluster 1 has 290 venues spread out over 58 locations. And it has a low presence of banks, just 2. On the other hand, it has 3 police stations, which offers any prospective FSC some level of security. The low concentration of banks plus the presence of 3 police stations makes this cluster worth looking at.  \n  \nCluster 2 has 550 venues spread out over 110 locations. It has 5 banks, and 3 police stations. The concentration of banks in this cluster is low, which is good, however it does not compete well with Cluster 1 in number of police staions per location. Cluster 2 has 3 police stations to 110 locations, while cluster 1 has 3 police stations to 58 locations.  \n  \nCluster 3 has 190 venues spread out over 38 locations. This cluster has a high number of banks, 7, and it has no police station within the 3000m radius. Any location within this cluster will be a bad choice, just like Cluster 5.  \n  \nCluster 4 has 430 venues spread out over 86 locations. This cluster has many small businesses plus it has no bank at all. That is good on the business side for a prospective FSC, however, there is no police station within the 3000m radius.  \n  \n## RECOMMENDATION  \n  \nHaving completed the analysis of the clustered locations, I recommend that locations within Cluster 1 be reviewed, and a choice made from within it.  \n  \n## CONCLUSION  \n  \nFor an FSC to thrive in Edo State, Nigeria, not all rural or semi-rural areas will be profitable for the business. A holistic look at other factors besides the remoteness of the location need to be considered. A good location will be where the threat of the presence of a major competitor is eliminated or reduced to the barest minimum. It will also be a place where some level of security will be assured, giving the nature of the business.  \n  \n",
